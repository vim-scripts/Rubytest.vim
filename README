Rubytest.vim will help you to run ruby test (including vanilla test, rspec, shoulda etc.) in vim.

Installation
------------

Unzip downloaded file and copy rubytest.vim to your ~/.vim/plugin directory.

Usage
-----

After installation, press <Leader>t will run the test under your cursor if you are editing a ruby test file.

example:

$ cd <your rails/merb root>
$ vim test/unit/user_test.rb
(move cursor into a test case, press <Leader>t)

(<Leader> is mapping to '\&#039 by default in vim)

Be default, the plugin will print output in terminal. You can change this behavior by putting this line in your vimrc file:

  let g:rubytest_in_quickfix = 1

With this set, test errors will be displayed in quickfix window, and you can jump to the error location quickly by select the error message and hit return (or 'Ctrl-w return' to open it in new window).

You can customize the command which will be used to run the test case by settting these options in your vimrc file:

  let g:rubytest_cmd_test = "ruby %p"
  let g:rubytest_cmd_testcase = "ruby %p -n '/%c/'"
  let g:rubytest_cmd_spec = "spec -f specdoc %p"
  let g:rubytest_cmd_example = "spec -f specdoc %p -e '%c'"
  let g:rubytest_cmd_feature = "cucumber %p"
  let g:rubytest_cmd_story = "cucumber %p -n '%c'"

(%p will be replaced by the path of test file, %c will be replaced by the name of test case under cursor)

Default Key Bindings
--------------------

<Leader>t: run test case under cursor
<Leader>T: run all tests in file
<Leader>l: run the last test, from any buffer

You can change default key bindings:

  map <Leader>\ <Plug>RubyTestRun " change from <Leader>t to <Leader>\
  map <Leader>] <Plug>RubyFileRun " change from <Leader>T to <Leader>]
  map <Leader>/ <Plug>RubyTestRunLast " change from <Leader>l to <Leader>/
